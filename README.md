# Newton Forward & Backward Interpolation (Qt GUI)

This is a C++ application with Qt GUI and [muParser](https://beltoforion.de/en/muparser/) library that demonstrates **Newton's Forward and Backward Interpolation** methods with:

- Interactive table for data input
- Polynomial equation generation
- Evaluation of the polynomial at a given `x`
- Newton-Raphson method to solve for `x` given `y`
- Visual switching between Forward and Backward methods

## üöÄ Features

- Create a data table with `X` and `f(X)`
- Compute divided differences and generate interpolation polynomial
- Calculate `f(x)` at any input `x`
- Calculate `x` from `f(x)` using Newton-Raphson
- Choose between **Forward** and **Backward** interpolation

## üß∞ Requirements

- Qt 5 or 6 (tested on Qt 5.15+)
- muParser library
